Growth trends are very similar between both countries, with spikes and falls in similar years with a small shift of one or 2 years. I'm not sure what it means, but it 
could mean economical changes reflect slowly in Brazil than in Portugal.

Here we can see how the GDP of Brazil and Portugal (and some other countries) changed over the years. The 2000s were great for the economies of almost every country: Portugal's GDP doubled and Brazil's grew three times. On the other hand, the 90s and 2010s were not so great economically-wise.
